Issue #2
```
test:execute]     ✗ James ensures that a Promise does equal 'Curry Blake' (1ms)
[test:execute] 
[test:execute]       Difference (+ expected, - actual):
[test:execute] 
[test:execute]       - a Promise
[test:execute]       + 'Curry Blake'
[test:execute] 
```

try with 
 Log.the(Property.of(LastResponse.body<MessageDto>()).author.answeredBy(actor)),
 get back:
 ```
 ✓ James logs: a Promise (0ms)
[test:execute]       a Promise:
[test:execute]       'Curry Blake'
```

How to share state between steps?
Using TakeNotes

 ConfigurationError: James can't TakeNotes yet. Did you give them the ability to do so?

  
  Fix: 
  TakeNotes.usingAnEmptyNotepad()

The usingAnEmptyNotepad is a function!

Note.of to retrieve the data "author" does not work
```
Log.the(Note.of('author')),
Log.the(Note.of(q`$(author)`)), 
```  
both does not work

Fix:
  TakeNote.of(
        Question.about<string>(`Author`, actor => {
          return author; // Actual value
        })
      ).as('Author'),


  Log.the(Note.of('Author')),
